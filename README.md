# TesselBox

[![Open Source Helpers](https://www.codetriage.com/tesselstudio/tesselbox-game/badges/users.svg)](https://www.codetriage.com/tesselstudio/tesselbox-game)

A 2D sandbox adventure game inspired by *Terraria*, but built on a **hexagonal grid**.

Explore worlds, mine resources, build structures, craft items, fight enemies, and survive — all in beautiful hex tiles.


## Migration Notice

**Sorry!**  
The game is currently migrating from a pure-Python prototype to  **Golang ** language  
This refactor improves performance (Go for core engine/world/physics) 

Expect some features to be temporarily broken or incomplete during this phase.  
Thanks for your patience — progress is ongoing!
